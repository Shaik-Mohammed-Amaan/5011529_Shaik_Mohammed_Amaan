Linear Search:

Description: Linear search involves iterating through each element in the dataset until the desired element is found or
the end of the dataset is reached.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.
Use Case: Suitable for unsorted datasets or when the dataset size is small.

Binary Search:

Description: Binary search is an efficient algorithm that works on sorted datasets. It divides the dataset into two
halves and determines which half contains the target element, recursively narrowing down the search range.
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.
Use Case: Suitable for large, sorted datasets.

**Analysis**

Time Complexity:

Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of books.
Best Case: O(1) (if the book is the first element).
Worst Case: O(n) (if the book is the last element or not found).

Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of books.
Best Case: O(1) (if the book is at the middle index in the first comparison).
Worst Case: O(log n) (requires multiple comparisons and narrowing down).

**Comparison and Use Cases**

Linear Search:
Use: When the dataset is unsorted, or the dataset size is relatively small, making the overhead of sorting unnecessary.
Advantages: Simple to implement and does not require data to be sorted.
Binary Search:
Use: When the dataset is sorted, and fast search times are crucial, especially in large datasets.
Advantages: Faster than linear search for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
