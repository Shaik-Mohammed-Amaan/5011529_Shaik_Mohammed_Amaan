**Big O Notation**

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space
requirements in terms of the input size (n). It provides a way to classify algorithms according to their worst-case or
asymptotic behavior.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:

Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations.
For example, in a search operation, the best case occurs when the target element is the first element in the dataset.

Average Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the average number of operations,
averaged over all possible inputs of a given size.

Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations.
For example, in a search operation, the worst case occurs when the target element is not present or is the last element
in the dataset.

**Analysis**

Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) (Target element is the first element)
Average Case: O(n) (Target element is randomly located)
Worst Case: O(n) (Target element is the last element or not present)
Space Complexity: O(1) (No extra space is used)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) (Target element is at the mid-point of the array)
Average Case: O(log n) (Search space is halved each time)
Worst Case: O(log n) (Target element is not present)
Space Complexity: O(1) (No extra space is used)

Suitability for E-commerce Platform:

Linear Search: It is simple to implement and does not require the array to be sorted. However, it is inefficient for large
datasets due to its O(n) time complexity.

Binary Search: It is more efficient than linear search for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(log n).
However, it requires the array to be sorted, which could involve additional overhead if the dataset is frequently updated.

For an e-commerce platform, where fast search performance is critical due to large inventories, binary search
is more suitable if the dataset is sorted or can be kept sorted with minimal overhead.
